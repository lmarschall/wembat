## What is Wembat?

Wembat is a powerful, yet tiny framework that gives your users passkey/WebAuthn sign‑in and lets you encrypt data client‑side using the PRF extension — with an API that stays out of your way. Bring your own UI, wire up a couple of actions, and you’re done.

## Why you should adopt Wembat?

🔒 Passwordless & phishing‑resistant by design (WebAuthn + passkeys)

🧪 TypeScript-first client with clean, minimal APIs

🧩 Drop‑in backend with a dashboard to manage apps & keys

🔐 Built‑in encryption derived from device credentials via PRF

🖥️ Multi‑device onboarding & session linking out of the box

Based on the awesome work of [SimpleWebAuthn](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn)

## What does it look like?

Manage your applications with an intuitive dashboard.
